## Tempus est pecunia; scientia sit potentia

A record of the events surrounding the start of https://harbinger.systems

### What we do

Our service quickly notifies investors and traders when we discover news articles about the shares, stocks, forex and crypto investments.  

### How we do it

We ingest a quarter of a million articles from a thousand online news sources each month and usually deliver a notification within two minutes of the first publication of news relevant to your investment interests.

**We observe** market and trading information from LSE, NASDAQ and cryptocurrency exchanges via a network of continuous, real time suppliers.  Add the news sources that you trust.

**We analyse** whether content is relevant to your portfolio.  Enhance your price charts with news, search and share our analysis.

**We integrate** with your messaging solutions and notify you immediately when we find something relevant for you.

Our capable, effective APIs are available for your applications and products.

## Our backlog

  * ~~Relocate to Ireland~~
  * ~~Web Summit in Portugal~~
  * MoneyConf in Dublin

### Harbinger Notification Of The Week

At 0832 today Harbinger triggered a notification for FX:EUR-GBP when the Financial Times published an article about the the UK reaching a milestone agreement with the EU regarding their exit strategy.  Five minutes later, the rate jumped from below 0.8705 to over 0.872.  Join us at https://harbinger.systems.

### Progress

Harbinger is now integrated with that lowest common denominator of communications, electronic mail.  Not everyone has Telegram or Discord or whatever it is people are using instead of Skype right now. This might be the corollary of Zawinski's Law. http://catb.org/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html

We found that some of the ideas we've grown used to over time are difficult to describe to people who are unfamiliar with our service.  This isn't uncommon when people focus on a specific area for a while, accept a local lingua franca and normalise their own language to efficiently discuss that area.  We adopted terms based in our personal experiences, which turned out to be confusing to other people.

When we went to find out what names and terms other people in the world use, we found that there's plenty of discussion and a heap of different answers.  We learned about assets, securities, vehicles, opportunities, markets, the exchange of value and many more things.  Turns out that the SEC had a similar problem, but we didn't end up using half a paragraph that included the word projects in double quotes.

All this learning informed prototypes cobbled together in a 30-day trial from https://sketchapp.com.  Simple to use, reminiscent of Macromedia's Flash interface and a time when all this was fields.

### Plans

Ssh ! Secret management is on the agenda, more work on the interface and something to do with commodities.

### Footnotes

https://soundcloud.com/harbinger/harbinger-99-coins has been today's soundtrack for infrastructure upgrades.  The name is a total coincidence.

## Saturday, December 2nd, 2017

We discussed the people who will use Harbinger in depth in a series of conversations with Max[1], looking at the service from different perspectives and throwing our ideas together into a collaborative whiteboard[2].

We're considering engaging a copy writer to improve our enthusiastic scribblings.  Any suggestions ?

The analysis platform gained new data from NASDAQ and new filtering functionality, so watching markets will be easier.  

The notification platform got some useful abstraction which will make life easier when we plug into ... whatever messenger systems we're using in a couple of years.

Connecting to the Harbinger bot on Telegram got much easier.

Harbinger spotted an article from Reuters[3] criticising quality at Tesla.  Sure enough, the stock fell from 317 to 302 over the following three hours.  Bitcoin obviously but even The Sun is covering that.

Wondering what Harbinger would look like in VR[4] ?

Throw a log on the fire, set trading alarms and commit code.  Onward.

"Life moves pretty fast sometimes.  If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." -- Ferris Bueller

We're looking for a hundred users to provide feedback.  You want in, sign up.

After relaxing with a functional service, we are now facing a class of challenges I call Matroshkas because each one has another inside it.  Matroshkas cause recursive to-do lists, late nights, forgetfulness and irritation if you let them.  Hot food, solid sleep and fresh air help.

To get money from subscribers, we need to hook the payment system into a business bank account.  To get a bank account, we need to register with the revenue, file initial returns and so on.  To register, we need to decide on the legal structure ... and so on.  Wheels within wheels.

If we only accept crypto-currencies, we don't need a bank account or any of the other processes and structures required by fiat transactions.  I'm looking at you, VAT MOSS.  We could save lots of time and concentrate on the service, so we've set up a Bitcoin wallet.  Tell us if you want to use it.

Tell us other things too ! Which messengers should we integrate with first ? Which markets do you want activating ? Which news sources shall we watch ?  We'll be running a bunch of surveys, but feel free to just get in touch and tell us.

We have met our mentor and already gained pragmatic, grounding advice.  We're amping up our market and competition analysis to improve the business plan and the revenue forecasts.

We've visited Paul Healy at the Rubicon Centre at Cork Institute of Technology.  Nice place, productive meeting.

We talked to lots of accountants in Cork and think we've chosen the right one.  Open, helpful, knowledgable, thorough and responsive.

Our application for AWS Activate Builders program was successful.

We applied for Dublin Tech Summit 2018 but it's way too expensive to take a stall.  Maybe we just visit.

I'm @neilharbinger on Twitter.  Tell me about if you'd pay with Bitcoin, what messengers you use, if it's worth attending Dublin Tech Summit, if there are sources we should be watching and people we should be talking to and most of all, if you want to be one of the hundred who get access to the product early.

We didn't need go-lang in the end as the Bash client proved eminently capable.

It's been a while since the last update but we've been in Portugal at Web Summit.  A truly international event on a massive scale, with something like sixty thousand attendees contained a diversity of interesting people, ideas, products and services.  We attended workshops, talks and joined conversations about all manner of topics usually circling back to artificial intelligence and machine learning.  In the stands, we met

The new remix of the web site was polished up in time to appear with us at Web Summit.  We got to demo to Shiven Ramji, head of product for Digital Ocean, which was challenging and informative.  He offered some encouragement, suggestions and useful criticism.  Gustav at Google set up a meeting with jetstack.io to talk Kubernetes. Good to compare ideas and directions. Amazon introduced us to a splendid solutions architect and invited us to apply for their Activate program for startups.

Lisbon is a thoroughly enjoyable city.  Excellent mushroom and truffle pizza at the market, so much street art, views from the turrets of Castelo de San Jorge, good music, friendly people, cheap transport. Go there.

Back at base, the local enterprise office in Cork are helping us find mentoring so we can start validating our non-technical plans and strategies.  We've talked to a number of accountants to get an understanding of the company registration process and get an idea of costs.  A long night in Lisbon got us a first attempt at revenue forecasting based on our market research so far.  I know, I know - we get time in Portugal and end up sat in front of spreadsheets.  We know how to rock a party ;)

Happy to get a first, refreshing view of the site design.

After a flurry of last minute checks, everything's booked for https://websummit.com.  We just have to charge lots of batteries and get to the airport.

So far, architecture automation has been entirely in Bash and it's been fast and reliable.  To get to the next mangnitude of speed, a choice has to be made between the higher level language API client libraries that are available.   It's possible with Bash, but it's good to take the opportunity to try out a new language once in a while.  After discarding the non-starters - thanks but no thanks .Net - it boils down to a choice between Go and NodeJS.

It's an experiment and we're already using lots of NodeJS so [Go wins this round](https://golang.org) !

## Friday, October 20th, 2017

The tropical storm dropped trees on the power lines and shut down power, water and communications for several days but progress was still made.

Payment features for the API and firehose are in testing and article classification has started, so that neural networks can be trained.

The process of registering the business started.  Registering a new business with the Revenue requires a Personal Public Service Number.  Getting a PPS number feels like a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  The experience serves as a reminder that there are still problems out there that can be resolved with web applications.

Online services can verify a passport in seconds.  Let's compare that with the PPS number experience.

A protracted session with the verbose but thorough 'Starting A Business' section of https://revenue.ie revealed a link to another government site, http://www.welfare.ie at which one can make an appointment with an office to get the form you need to fill in to apply for a PPS number.  'Online appointments' are offered through https://www.mywelfare.ie but without a PPSN you cannot register there to book an appointment.

Digging around on the Welfare site revealed a telephone number for a help desk.  The person who answered the phone was sympathetic but unable to help.  They provided another phone number for a different office who, while unable to actually help, did know who could and provided the telephone number for that office.

After confirming that the office does cover this area and having a little discussion about the reason for getting a PPS number ('I want a PPS number to register a business and register a vehicle' 'Well, which is it - do you want to start a business or register a vehicle ?' 'Both, ideally') an appointment was booked for the middle of next week.  At which an official might be persuaded to provide the PPSN application form.  Maybe.

Some insider advice on navigating these systems will no doubt be beneficial so a meeting with the local enterprise office is in the calendar.

Looking forward to a change of pace and some calm coast air in Lisboa at https://websummit.com !

First week in Ireland complete

    $ mv ~ ireland

Packing the house up, loading the van and driving several thousand kilometers with a cat across Spain, France and Ireland was an experience.

Meanwhile, performance improvements have seen the average time to detect news halved from about four minutes to about two.  The platform should be able to cope with enough concurrent users to be viable.

Web Summit is fast approaching, so we're concentrating on getting the site presentable.

## Wednesday, September 13th, 2017

Last day in the office

## Tuesday, September 12th, 2017 

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) usually has something interesting.  Today I found a free economics course at https://www.core-econ.org and [a font for placing sparkline graphs in text](http://aftertheflood.co/projects/atf-spark).

Elsewhere, [startup resources](https://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/Start-a-Business-in-Ireland/Information-Store-for-Start-ups) at Enterprise Ireland, making more revisions to our introductory copy.

## Monday, September 11th, 2017

Search time was reduced from an average of 4000ms to under 200ms !

The next two weeks is going to be a happy kind of chaos, so it's time for a code freeze before we reconnect from a completely different location.

Yoda the cat has *no idea* what's about to happen.

## Friday, September 8th, 2017

Friday evening in Europe was Friday morning for the west coast of North America.  Big thanks to James for spending time on Skype for a motivating and challenging chat about where Harbinger is at the moment, how we got there and where we are heading.

Not sure if the pitch delivery practice is paying off, or if it's standard operating procedure in LA to react with a hearty, enthusiastic "Amen brother !" but the conversation was appreciated.

## You have enough money to trade

Different people say different things about investment.

  * "Don't risk what you can't lose"
  * "Risk everything you can lose"
  * "I don't have enough spare money to invest"

This seems unfair.  Let's let the data decide.

Assuming you have ten to invest.  Euros, dollars, pounds sterling.  Doesn't matter.

Can you make one percent ?  In a day ?

Forex, stocks and shares, cryptocurrency.  Again, it doesn't matter.

If you can do that regularly, you need some dedication.

After ten days of making 1% every day, your 10 becomes 11.05 which hardly seems worth the effort, but keep at it.

After a hundred days of making 1% a day, your 10 becomes 27.05 which is a little disappointing.  A hundred days and it's doubled but not much more.

Let's fast-forward to a year.  After 365 days of making 1%, your 10 becomes 377.83 !  Now that's starting to get interesting but it's like grinding through the early levels of a video game.  Tedious.  Is this worth it ?

After five hundred days, your 10 becomes 1,447.73 which is less tedious.

Day 750 in the 1% a day grind and your 10 becomes 17,419.29.  Do you have motivation yet ?

After 1,000 days of making 1% at a time, your 10 becomes 209,591.56

|Day | Closing balance|
|--|--:|
|0 | 10.00|
|10 | 11.05|
|100 | 27.05|
|365 | 377.83|
|500 | 1,447.73|
|750 | 17,419.29|
|1,000 | 209,591.56|

Time is money, information is power

## What we're starting with

Our initial toolset is designed to keep costs down and to stay out of the way

 * Telegram for day to day conversation and occasional calls
 * Trello for reminders and prioritisation
 * A couple of cloud computing suppliers
 * A Raspberry Pi
 * A couple of domestic ADSL connections
 
Well, I say domestic ADSL.  Mine is via squarial from the top of a nearby mountain, so it's an 'up to' 2 megs deal, depending on weather, which has been workable so far.  SSH connections don't need much bandwidth.

The intermittent and spiky power supply has eaten a UPS, though.  I'm hoping that relocating will bring some stability of power and connectivity.

Last day in the office

## Tuesday, September 12th, 2017 

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) usually has something interesting.  Today I found a free economics course at https://www.core-econ.org and [a font for placing sparkline graphs in text](http://aftertheflood.co/projects/atf-spark).

Elsewhere, [startup resources](https://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/Start-a-Business-in-Ireland/Information-Store-for-Start-ups) at Enterprise Ireland, making more revisions to our introductory copy.

Search time was reduced from an average of 4000ms to under 200ms !

The next two weeks is going to be a happy kind of chaos, so it's time for a code freeze before we reconnect from a completely different location.

Yoda the cat has *no idea* what's about to happen.

## Friday, September 8th, 2017

Friday evening in Europe was Friday morning for the west coast of North America.  Big thanks to James for spending time on Skype for a motivating and challenging chat about where Harbinger is at the moment, how we got there and where we are heading.

Not sure if the pitch delivery practice is paying off, or if it's standard operating procedure in LA to react with a hearty, enthusiastic "Amen brother !" but the conversation was appreciated.

## You have enough money to trade

Different people say different things about investment.

  * "Don't risk what you can't lose"
  * "Risk everything you can lose"
  * "I don't have enough spare money to invest"

This seems unfair.  Let's let the data decide.

Assuming you have ten to invest.  Euros, dollars, pounds sterling.  Doesn't matter.

Can you make one percent ?  In a day ?

Forex, stocks and shares, cryptocurrency.  Again, it doesn't matter.

If you can do that regularly, you need some dedication.

After ten days of making 1% every day, your 10 becomes 11.05 which hardly seems worth the effort, but keep at it.

After a hundred days of making 1% a day, your 10 becomes 27.05 which is a little disappointing.  A hundred days and it's doubled but not much more.

Let's fast-forward to a year.  After 365 days of making 1%, your 10 becomes 377.83 !  Now that's starting to get interesting but it's like grinding through the early levels of a video game.  Tedious.  Is this worth it ?

After five hundred days, your 10 becomes 1,447.73 which is less tedious.

Day 750 in the 1% a day grind and your 10 becomes 17,419.29.  Do you have motivation yet ?

After 1,000 days of making 1% at a time, your 10 becomes 209,591.56

|Day | Closing balance|
|--|--:|
|0 | 10.00|
|10 | 11.05|
|100 | 27.05|
|365 | 377.83|
|500 | 1,447.73|
|750 | 17,419.29|
|1,000 | 209,591.56|

Time is money, information is power

## What we're starting with

Our initial toolset is designed to keep costs down and to stay out of the way

 * Telegram for day to day conversation and occasional calls
 * Trello for reminders and prioritisation
 * A couple of cloud computing suppliers
 * A Raspberry Pi
 * A couple of domestic ADSL connections
 
Well, I say domestic ADSL.  Mine is via squarial from the top of a nearby mountain, so it's an 'up to' 2 megs deal, depending on weather, which has been workable so far.  SSH connections don't need much bandwidth.

The intermittent and spiky power supply has eaten a UPS, though.  I'm hoping that relocating will bring some stability of power and connectivity.

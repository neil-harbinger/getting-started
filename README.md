# Journal

Our initial toolset is designed to keep costs down and to stay out of the way

 * Telegram for day to day conversation and occasional calls
 * Trello for reminders and prioritisation
 * A couple of cloud computing suppliers
 * A Raspberry Pi
 * A couple of domestic ADSL connections
 
Well, I say domestic ADSL.  Mine is via squarial from the top of a nearby mountain, so it's an 'up to' 2 megs deal, depending on weather, which has been workable so far.  SSH connections don't need much bandwidth.

The intermittent and spiky power supply has eaten a UPS, though.  I'm hoping that relocating will bring some stability of power and connectivity.

## You have enough money to trade

Different people say different things about investment.

  * "Don't risk what you can't lose"
  * "Risk everything you can lose"
  * "I don't have enough spare money to invest"

This seems unfair.  Let's let the data decide.

Assuming you have ten to invest.  Euros, dollars, pounds sterling.  Doesn't matter.

Can you make one percent ?  In a day ?

Forex, stocks and shares, cryptocurrency.  Again, it doesn't matter.

If you can do that regularly, you need some dedication.

After ten days of making 1% every day, your 10 becomes 11.05 which hardly seems worth the effort, but keep at it.

After a hundred days of making 1% a day, your 10 becomes 27.05 which is a little disappointing.  A hundred days and it's doubled but not much more.

Let's fast-forward to a year.  After 365 days of making 1%, your 10 becomes 377.83 !  Now that's starting to get interesting but it's like grinding through the early levels of a video game.  Tedious.  Is this worth it ?

After five hundred days, your 10 becomes 1,447.73 which is less tedious.

Day 750 in the 1% a day grind and your 10 becomes 17,419.29.  Do you have motivation yet ?

After 1,000 days of making 1% at a time, your 10 becomes 209,591.56

|Day | Closing balance|
|__|__|
|0 | 10.00|
|10 | 11.05|
|100 | 27.05|
|365 | 377.83|
|500 | 1,447.73|
|750 | 17,419.29|
|1,000 | 209,591.56|

Time is money, information is power

Our initial toolset is designed to keep costs down and to stay out of the way

 * Telegram for day to day conversation and occasional calls
 * Trello for reminders and prioritisation
 * A couple of cloud computing suppliers
 * A Raspberry Pi
 * A couple of domestic ADSL connections
 
Well, I say domestic ADSL.  Mine is via squarial from the top of a nearby mountain, so it's an 'up to' 2 megs deal, depending on weather, which has been workable so far.  SSH connections don't need much bandwidth.

The intermittent and spiky power supply has eaten a UPS, though.  I'm hoping that relocating will bring some stability of power and connectivity.
